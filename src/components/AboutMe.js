        Hi, my name is Brenton Hershner and I'm a Software Engineer. I started
        my career as a Mechanical Engineer and was promoted to Product Manager.
        Despite my success, I always had a passion for code. I would often write
        small snippets of code to help me and others with various tasks. In
        March 2021 I decided to take a huge professional risk. I quit my
        comfortable full-time job and joined a coding bootcamp. I loved every
        minute of the bootcamp. I woke up early to start coding before anyone
        else and was one of the last to sign off every night. On completing the
        program, I did so well that I was asked to stay and teach the next round
        of students while I job search. Rebuilding my career on a foundation of
        code really excites me! Iâ€™ve never felt better about the path in front
        of me and look forward to what the future holds.
